    "My goal is to examine the **effects of several socio-economic factors** on the **grades of secondary school students.** These analyses will allow us to predict student performance based upon a variety of features like study hours, alcohol comsumption, parent's education, etc.\n",

    "  1. Effect of Alcohol consumption on Student performance.\n",
    "  2. Does being in a relationship affect high school student performance?\n",
    "  3. Impact of a parent's education on student grades. This can be very useful as a lot of schools use parent's education as a criteria for admission. This analysis can present an argument either in favor or against this approach.\n",

    "My initial focus will be on understanding whether **alcohol comsumption** can have an **impact on student performance** or not. In United States, one in four individuals between the ages of 12 and 20 reported ninge drinking alcohol on a monthly basis ([source:niaaa.nih.gov](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/underage-drinking)).Underage drinking has become a very serious health concern and binge drinking by young people poses enormous health and safety risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been a steady rise in the number of teenagers found driving under the influence and this behaviour often leads to serious accidents resulting in property damage, injuries, and sometimes deadth as well ([source:drugfree.org](https://drugfree.org/drug-and-alcohol-news/23-of-teenssurveyed-admit-to-driving-under-influence-of-alcohol-or-drugs/)). Thus, it is critical that we implement prevention strategies during early adolescence to prevent escalation in alcohol consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will run similar analyses for multiple factors. Based upon my observations, I will try to build a **persona of a model student** who has the highest chance of academic success.\n",
    "\n",
    "This information can then be used by school districts, academic counsellors, and parents to help guide their students towards better school performance."
